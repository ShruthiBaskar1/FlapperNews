Reddit Clone built on MEAN stack

It's a project that has a Reddit/Hacker News clone using the MEAN stack. 

Through this project, I gained an understanding of MEAN stack including building a REST interface with Express.js 
on top of Node.js and using that interface to perform CRUD operations on a database via an AngularJS frontend.
